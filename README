1. PURPOSE
Qt is a very nice C++ library which is all but necessary to make the language
bearable (in the eyes of the author); libpurple is the pre-eminent multi-
protocol communications library, which is useful in a number of cross-platform
applications. 

QPurple attempts to provide a Qt interface to libpurple.  This is to be
accomplished by integrating libpurple with the Qt event loop, and providing
high-level wrapper classes which expose the libpurple core through signals and
slots.  In this way, a developer can start using libpurple in a Qt program, 
making use of constructs familiar to anyone who has used Qt.  

2. INSTALLATION
This library requires qmake to build.  The specifics depend on your platform; 
for more information read up on qmake. The result is a shared object which you
may put wherever the hell you want.  

3. ROADMAP
Roadmap for upcoming releases: 
* exposing the UI ops, etc as slots for other classes to fill in. You know, so
a program could use libpurple
* exposing accounts, buddy lists, and other integral objects as classes >_>
* updating the project file to link with libpurple on platforms other than unix
* coming up with more bullets

4. STATUS / NEWS

0.1.0, 26 July 2010
This is the inaugural version.  Event loop integration works, and a very stupid
and useless but nonetheless working program could link with this library and 
initialize the libpurple core, though nothing would be gained by it.
